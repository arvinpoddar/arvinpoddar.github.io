The theme of this hackathon was utilities for helping students and employees gradually get back to school and work. We decided to create Rotations, an automatic schedule generator that splits people into groups that alternate between working at home and coming into the office. The project accounts for the latest research in COVID prevention, along with office specifications, to create optimized seating charts and groupings. Furthermore, Rotations includes basic contact tracing features and safety scores, making it easy for admins to manage how people return to in-person activities.
